# MIPS Subset Emulator

This project emulates a subset of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA), closely aligned with the version used in undergraduate courses at the University of Waterloo. It is designed to help students and educators experiment with and understand MIPS instruction behavior in a Pythonic environment.

## Features

- Supports a subset of the MIPS ISA used in teaching
- Written in pure Python
- Includes a 32-bit integer class to mimic MIPS register behavior
- Basic I/O and memory operations
- Instruction parsing and execution
- Hexadecimal and decimal representation handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive use)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `MIPS.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in order to initialize the emulator and test MIPS instructions.

## File Structure

- `MIPS.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code, documentation, and examples.
